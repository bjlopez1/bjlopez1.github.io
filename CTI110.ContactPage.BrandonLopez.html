      <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
      <img src="Images/Picture of Me.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="240" class="cards"/>
      <p>My name is Brandon Lopez and I am 23 years old. I have been living in Raleigh, North Carolina since the age of 13 and I am a huge music fan. Since I was seven years old, I have played many different types of instruments throughout my life. I started playing the violin about 2 years. Afterwards, I played the flute and the piano for over a year. At the age of 10 years old, I fell in love with playing the drums. To this day, I can still play the drums and I have been for 13 years. In 2017, I started playing the guitar and I instantly fell in love with playing the guitar as well. Ever since I learned how to play the guitar, I have been writing and making music as a hobby. I would play the drums and the guitar in different tracks and put them together. I love being creative and putting my own music together. It is a huge accomplishment for me because I have always wanted to make my own songs since I was a child. Now, I can fulfill my dreams on creating music for the rest of my life. </p>
